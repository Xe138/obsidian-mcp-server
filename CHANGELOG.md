## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Updated config path examples from `.obsidian/**` to `templates/**` in tool descriptions to avoid implying hardcoded configuration directory paths
- Removed "MCP Server" from command display names per Obsidian plugin guidelines (commands now show as "Start server", "Stop server", etc.)
- Replaced deprecated `vault.delete()` with `app.fileManager.trashFile()` to respect user's trash preferences configured in Obsidian settings
- Extracted all inline JavaScript styles to semantic CSS classes with `mcp-*` namespace for better maintainability and Obsidian plugin compliance
- Applied CSS extraction to notification history modal for consistency

### Changed
- Command palette entries now display shorter names without redundant plugin name prefix
- File deletion operations now respect user's configured trash location (system trash or `.trash/` folder)
- Settings panel and notification history UI now use centralized CSS classes instead of inline styles
