# UX & Copy Guidelines

For UI text, commands, and settings:

## Text Formatting

- **Prefer sentence case** for headings, buttons, and titles
- Use clear, action-oriented imperatives in step-by-step copy
- Keep in-app strings short, consistent, and free of jargon

## UI References

- Use **bold** to indicate literal UI labels
- Prefer "select" for interactions
- Use arrow notation for navigation: **Settings → Community plugins**

## Examples

✅ Good:
- "Select **Settings → Community plugins**"
- "Enable the plugin"
- "Configure your API key"

❌ Avoid:
- "Go to Settings and then Community plugins"
- "Turn on the plugin"
- "Setup your API key"
